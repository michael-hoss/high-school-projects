## Background 

For the longer story, see my blog post here: (Medium blog post)

These projects were originally developed between 2009 and 2011 in Excel with VBA macros and Visual Basic (VB) 6.0. I decided to publish them in 2023, when the ancient 32 bit versions of VB/VBA are no longer supported. Therefore, I upgraded the code to make sure everything still runs on my Windows 11 machine in 2023.

## Running them yourself

Running any code here is at your own risk! I am pretty sure though that nothing bad will happen to your system.

- I also committed the compiled executables s.th. you can start playing the games without having to compile on your own. 
- The upgrades from VB 6.0 to VB.NET were done using the mobilize.net Visual Basic Upgrade Companion (VBUC).
- The executables based on VB 6.0 should still work on 64 bit Windows 11 machines.
