# VB.NET Upgraded Code

This directory got generated by the [Mobilize.Net's Visual Basic Upgrade Companion (VBUC)](https://www.mobilize.net/products/app-migrations/vbuc)). I deleted and git-ignored a lot of unnecessary files, but some may remain. 

One cool thing is that when I upgraded several independent applications at the same time, the boilerplate code for compatibility was only created once in `UpgradeSupport` and is shared by the different applications from `Upgraded`.

It was also nice that the tool generated me new functions with error messages in them for those old functions that could not be upgraded. I could go there and replace the error messages with the new code I needed to make it work again with minimal intervention.

I only upgraded some of the VB 6.0 applications because the others had either too many lines of code (would require commercial license of the upgrade tool) or there were unresolved upgrade problems.
